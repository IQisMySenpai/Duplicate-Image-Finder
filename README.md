# Duplicate Image Finder (DIF)

This is a simplified and cleaner version of the code from:
[Blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/finding-duplicate-images-with-python-71c04ec8051)
[Github](https://github.com/elisemercury/Duplicate-Image-Finder)

It only uses the most common libraries and has some parts removed, like checking for rotated images. 
I changed the code to fit more into my end goal.
